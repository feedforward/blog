## One Line Summary
* A targeted adversarial perturbation generation using a generative model.

## Motivation
* Adversarial perturbations are shown to fool the state-of-the-art networks, most of the approaches for generating the perturbations use gradient based optimization, this approach uses the neural networks for generating the adversarial perturbations. 

## Detailed Summary
* AdvGAN can attack black-box models by training a distilled model. We propose to dynamically train the distilled model with query information and achieve high
black-box attack success rate and targeted black-box attack, which is difficult to achieve for transferability-based black-box attacks.

* AdvGAN on M ˛adry et al.’s MNIST challenge (2017a) achieved 88.93% accuracy on the published robust model in the semi-whitebox setting and 92.76% in the blackbox
setting, which wins the top position in the challenge .


## Novelty and Contributions
* Different from the previous optimization-based methods,  a conditional adversarial network to directly produce adversarial examples which are both perceptually realistic and achieve state-of-the-art attack success rate against different target models.

* We use the state-of-the-art defense methods to defend against adversarial examples and show that AdvGAN achieves much higher attack success rate under current defenses.

## Network Details

* Generator takes the input the image and outputs the corresponding perturbaiton.
* image added to the perturbaiton fools the target classifier.
