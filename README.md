# Summary of Deep Learning Papers in Computer Vision 

[DL Papers website](https://krishnacodes.github.io/)

In recent years the many computer vision tasks like classification, segmentation, 3d-perception, pose estimation, sketch generation and others which are considered mark of human intelligence are solved by deep neural nets with competitive accuracies sometimes even better than human performance, but neural nets have their own shortcomings like adversarial perturbations.

So deep learning is a very active area of research, i summarize all the recent papers in this blog posts.
