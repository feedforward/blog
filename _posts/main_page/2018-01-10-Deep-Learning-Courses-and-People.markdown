Few Resources for starting with deep learning, legenedary people in the area and few professors i had the pleasure to work under.


# [Summary of Deep Learning Papers in Computer Vision](https://krishnacodes.github.io/)



In recent years the many computer vision tasks like classification, segmentation, 3d-perception, pose estimation, sketch generation and others which are considered mark of human intelligence are solved by deep neural nets with competitive accuracies sometimes even better than human performance, but neural nets have their own shortcomings like adversarial perturbations.

So deep learning is a very active area of research, i summarize all the recent papers in this blog posts.

## Deep Learning in a nutshell
