## One Line Summary
* A generative approach to model the distribution of adversarial perturbations.

## Motivation
* Existing methods present optimization approaches that solve for a fooling objective with an imperceptibility constraint to craft the perturbations. However, for a given classifier, they generate
one perturbation at a time.

## Detailed Summary
* The architecture of the proposed model is inspired from that of GANs
* Loss formulation has diversity objective that helps generate the diverse set of perturbations.
* Fooling objective is formaulated by passing the benign batch and adversarial batch through the target classifier
* While the diversity objective is formulated by passing the adversarial batcha and the shuffled adversarial batch.


## Novelty and Contributions
* Achieve state-of-the-art fooling rates.
* Generated perturbaitons exhibit wide variety.
* Execellent cross model generalizability and first model to use generative modeling for adversarial perturbations.


## Network Details
![Network figure]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/fdssfadsfads.png)
* Network has a Generator that is update to generate the adversarial perturbations.
* Target classifier is used as is without any training, but the output of target classifier to is used to update the generator.
